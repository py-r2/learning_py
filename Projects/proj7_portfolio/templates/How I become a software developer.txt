Hi, I'm Romeo Rauta – a Python-Flask software engineer from Calgary, Canada

My journey as a developer started back in 1993 in the University. Then life drove me to SysAdmin rather until...  when I had a challenge to accomplish a free Python online course on CodeAcademy. Was enough for me to dive in to this wonderful world and continued with few other Python, Flask, SQL, Linux etc. courses on Udemy.

The next step was to find guidance on to what skills to acquire and to create a portfolio.

For guidance I asked everyone I found online or around me and had anything to do with programming. As for the portfolio I found lots of online resources built one Python-Flask-PostgreSQL login app with sign-up option and this portfolio website.
