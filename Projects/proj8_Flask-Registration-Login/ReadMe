Flask-Registration-Login application

Technologies used:
- Bootstrap to generate html forms and elements
- Flask for the framework
- PostgreSQL for database
- Atom as file editor
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Ubuntu 16 as operating system

Description:
The application has a Home landing page that uses Bootstrap CSS design and
has a top menu with 3 buttons:Home, Login, SignUp. The Login page will log you
in to a Dashboard page while Registration will give you the option to create
an account with username, password, email and company fields. User account
data is going to be stored in to PostgreSQL database.
For security (to generate/check password hash) we used werkzeug.security module.

Pre-requisites:
Before being able to run this application you'll have to create a PostgreSQL
database on to your computer named portfolio_website with default username
'postgres' and no login password.
